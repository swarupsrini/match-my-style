# MatchMyStyle

A website that uses clothes from your personal wardrobe to identify your 'style' and intelligently filters brand catalogs by 'matching' your style.

## Tech

`React`, `Firebase`, `Cloud Firestore`, `Google Cloud Vision API`

## Motive

When you walk in a store or view a catalog online, you have tons of options to choose from. It can be difficult to pick and choose which piece of clothing you like the best. MatchMyStyle aims to solve that problem. It is a website that automates this task for you, by using powerful tools like Computer Vision to detect patterns in your clothing tastes and reduces the time it takes for you to pick a piece of clothing.

## Development

Developed in a team of 4. This is a React application that utilizes Cloud Firestore to store our dataset of catalog images. The Google Cloud Vision API was used to build the core 'matching' system.
